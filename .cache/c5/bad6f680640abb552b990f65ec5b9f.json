Biking is an integral part of Danish culture; there are more bikes than people in Copenhagen. Our tour guide specializes in urban biking design. She took us through various neighborhoods of the city, highlighting how Copenhagen promotes commuting and livable urban space.</p>\r\n                <p>Many streets in the city have protected biking lanes along the sidewalk and narrower streets for cars. The narrower streets force cars to slow down and be aware of their surroundings. Parking is very expensive in the city center, further restricting cars. The result is streets teeming with life, an organic mass of pedestrians, bikes, and motor vehicles unlike anything in America.</p>\r\n                <p>After our tour, I branched off with some friends to go to Freetown Christiania. Freetown Christiania is a sort of commune on a former military base. It has no building codes and has its own rules, such as no photography. It's also notorious for open marijuana sales. Although weed is technically illegal in Denmark, the police generally leave Freetown be. There were open air markets, and the place smelled predictably terrible.</p>\r\n                <p>The rest of the day was pretty normal with some class and schoolwork. Another day, another dollar.</p>\r\n                <p>I'll try to upload more pictures as time goes by. Right now, we are focused on creating the basic framework of the site. Expect more interesting features in the future.</p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <h1 class=\"page-header\">Jake's Travel Journal</h1>\r\n            <div class=\"content-post\">\r\n                <div class=\"blog-header\">\r\n                    <h2 class=\"blog-post-title\">Arrivals</h2>\r\n                    <p>5/21/2019 - Copenhagen, Denmark</p>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <p>Yesterday, I finally arrived in Copenhagen after many hours of travel. My flight was delayed out of Charlotte, so I had to sprint through Washington-Dulles to make my connection. It also took hours for my shuttle to finally make it.</p>\r\n                <p>My housing is right in the center of the city with a view of the Rundetaarn from my window. We have a courtyard with a firepit and cobblestone. It's only a 10 minute walk to the capitol building. The streets are filled with tourists and locals alike, and there is always a murmur of activity coming from the ground.</p>\r\n                <p>I took a nap when I arrived, then went for a walk with my roommate, Grant. We saw the painted buildings of Nyhavn, explored the Royal Library, and walked around Christiansborg Palace. Our group had a pizza dinner, and we played frisbee in the courtyard. I bought a book and some breakfast food in the nearby stores.</p>\r\n                <p>The next day, we went to our orientation at the Circus Theatre. After that, class began and we started learning about javascript and various other web development topics.</p>\r\n                <p>So far, my time in Copenhagen has been incredible, and I can't wait for the next few weeks.</p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            \r\n            <div class=\"content-post\">\r\n                <div class=\"blog-header\">\r\n                    <h2 class=\"blog-post-title\">Hello, World</h2>\r\n                    <p>5/14/2019 - Charlotte, NC</p>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <p>Hi, all!

After my Maymester program is finished, I will be taking a month and a half to backpack through Germany and France.</p>\r\n                <p>Please excuse the ugly website for now. I'll be working on making it look great over the next few weeks.</p>\r\n                <p>If you are interested in following my journey, be sure to bookmark this page.
