                    <p>5/21/2019 - Copenhagen, Denmark</p>
                </div>
                <p>Yesterday, I finally arrived in Copenhagen after many hours of travel. My flight was delayed out of Charlotte, so I had to sprint through Washington-Dulles to make my connection. It also took hours for my shuttle to finally make it.</p>
                <p>My housing is right in the center of the city with a view of the Rundetaarn from my window. We have a courtyard with a firepit and cobblestone. It's only a 10 minute walk to the capitol building. The streets are filled with tourists and locals alike, and there is always a murmur of activity coming from the ground.</p>
                <p>I took a nap when I arrived, then went for a walk with my roommate, Grant. We saw the painted buildings of Nyhavn, explored the Royal Library, and walked around Christiansborg Palace. Our group had a pizza dinner, and we played frisbee in the courtyard. I bought a book and some breakfast food in the nearby stores.</p>
                <p>The next day, we went to our orientation at the Circus Theatre. After that, class began and we started learning about javascript</p>

                <p>Hi, all! This is my first blog post/journal for my trip abroad. I'm <span>very</span> excited to both learn about web development and explore Copenhagen, the capital of Denmark. After my Maymester program is finished, I will be taking a month and a half to backpack through Germany and France.</p>
                <p>Please excuse the ugly website for now. I'll be working on making it look great over the next few weeks.</p>
                <p>If you are interested in following my journey, be sure to bookmark this page. This website will be updated with tons of cool features like commenting and interactive maps, so be sure to keep checking in!</p>
